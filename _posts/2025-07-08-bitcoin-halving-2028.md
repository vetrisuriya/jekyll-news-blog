## TL;DR
* The next Bitcoin halving is projected for **April 2028** (block 1,050,000).  
* Block rewards will drop from **3.125 BTC** to **1.5625 BTC**.  
* Historically, halvings compress supply, spark miner capitulation, and precede bull runs 6‑18 months later.

### 1. Quick Refresher: What Is a Halving?
Bitcoin’s code reduces the block subsidy roughly every 210,000 blocks. This baked‑in scarcity drives the long‑term supply curve toward the 21 million BTC cap.

### 2. Economic Ripples
| Cycle | Halving Date | Price 6 mo. later | 18 mo. later |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 2012  | Nov 28       | \$13 → \$120      | \$1 100      |
| 2016  | Jul 9        | \$650 → \$760     | \$19 500     |
| 2020  | May 11       | \$8 640 → \$28 000| \$64 000     |

_**Pattern**: muted first, explosive later._

### 3. Miner Dynamics
* **Older ASICs retire**, slashing hash‑rate temporarily.  
* Surviving farms often relocate to regions with sub‑\$0.03/kWh electricity.

### 4. How to Position Yourself
1. **Accumulate, don’t chase.** DCA well before hype peaks.  
2. **Review security.** Hardware wallets > custodial.  
3. **Diversify exposures.** Consider hash‑rate ETFs or mining‑rig royalties.

### 5. Risks & Wild Cards
* Regulatory curveballs (e.g., global ESG crackdowns).  
* Unexpected macro shocks—remember 2020’s COVID plunge?

## Key Takeaways
Halvings rarely pump _on the day_; they reset the four‑year narrative. Strategy: be early, stay solvent, and zoom‑out.
