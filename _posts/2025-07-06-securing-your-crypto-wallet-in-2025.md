Wallet UX has evolved from 12‑word seeds to **MPC**, **AA‑wallets**, and **passkeys**. Let’s map the landscape.

## 1. Seed Phrases (Legacy)
Pros: battle‑tested, offline storage  
Cons: human error, phishing, single point of failure

## 2. Multi‑Party Computation (MPC)
* Private key shards split across devices/servers.  
* Players: Fireblocks, Coinbase Wallet MPC.

## 3. Account Abstraction (AA, ERC‑4337)
* Smart wallets (e.g., **Safe**, **Soul Wallet**) enable social recovery, gas sponsorship, and batched transactions.  
* **Bundlers** relay TXs; users pay fees in any ERC‑20.

## 4. Passkeys & Biometrics
* FIDO2 passkeys stored in secure enclaves (iOS/Android).  
* Eliminates phishing of seeds yet hinges on device integrity.

## 5. Best‑Practice Checklist (2025 Edition)
- Enable **2‑of‑3 social recovery** guardians.  
- Whitelist withdrawal addresses.  
- Use **mitm‑resistant browsers** (Brave, Arc) for signing.  
- Keep a _“dead man’s switch”_ plan for heirs.
