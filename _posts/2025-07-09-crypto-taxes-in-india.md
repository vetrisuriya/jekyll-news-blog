India’s **Section 115BBH** still treats crypto as “Virtual Digital Assets” (VDAs). Quick refresher:

| Event                 | Tax Rate | Notes |
|-----------------------|----------|-------|
| **Transfer/Trade**    | 30 % flat on gains | No slab benefits |
| **TDS (Section 194S)**| 1 % on consideration | Deducted at source by exchanges |
| **Loss Offset**       | Not allowed against any income | _Carry‑forward_ disallowed |
| **Gift of VDA**       | Taxed in recipient’s hands | Fair‑value basis |

### Record‑Keeping Checklist
- 🔹 Exchange trade history CSVs  
- 🔹 On‑chain wallet exports (Etherscan, Polygonscan)  
- 🔹 Fiat on‑/off‑ramp bank statements  
- 🔹 NFT & airdrop valuations (use price‑at‑receipt)

### DIY vs. Software
* **DIY** fine if <50 TX/year.  
* Otherwise use tools like **KoinX**, **CoinTracker**, or **Zerodha Coin’s VDA module**.

### Pro Tip
Switching to LLP or Pvt Ltd? VDA gains still taxed at 30 %, but expense deduction opens up.
