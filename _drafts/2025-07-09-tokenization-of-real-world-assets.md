Real-world assets (RWAs) are entering the blockchain at scale. From bonds to buildings, DeFi is no longer just digital.

## üîç What Are RWAs?

RWAs are physical or off-chain assets represented as tokens on a blockchain. Examples include:

- Real estate deeds  
- U.S. Treasuries  
- Carbon credits  
- Luxury goods or IP rights

## üí° Why Tokenize?

| Benefit         | Description                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Liquidity       | Sell fractions of a \$10M property     |
| Accessibility   | Open global 24/7 markets               |
| Efficiency      | Smart contract settlement vs paperwork |
| Transparency    | Real-time audit trails onchain         |

## üß± Protocols Powering RWA

- **Centrifuge** ‚Äì tokenizes invoices and loans  
- **Ondo Finance** ‚Äì onchain T‚Äëbills and bonds  
- **Goldfinch** ‚Äì global credit protocol for real businesses  
- **Maple Finance** ‚Äì undercollateralized loans for institutions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Risks

- Oracle price manipulation  
- Regulatory gray zones (esp. securities laws)  
- Real-world enforcement of digital claims

## ‚úÖ Use Cases (Live in 2025)

- **DAOs earning 5% yield** via tokenized T-bills  
- **RWA-backed stablecoins** more resilient than algorithmic ones  
- **DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infra)** tracking IoT or solar output as yield

## Final Thought

RWAs bring trillions in TradFi value on-chain. The winners will build compliant, interoperable, and risk-aware bridges between the physical and digital.
