# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

<img src="{{ site.icon }}" style="width: 40px;">

Welcome to my crypto blog!
I'm [**Vetri Suriya**](https://vetrisuriya.in/), a blockchain enthusiast exploring the decentralized futureâ€”one block at a time.

This site exists to:
- Share insights on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and emerging chains.
- Break down complex crypto topics into simple language.
- Track market trends, regulations, and tech innovations.

### âœ¨ Why I Built This Blog

After years of deep-diving into crypto, DeFi, NFTs, and Web3, I wanted a place to document what I learnâ€”and help others avoid common pitfalls.
